For the course computational musicology, I have chosen my own playlist consisting mainly of Korean rap. 

As some might not know, the overall structuring in the Korean rap scence is one of the most prominent characteristics that stand out when looking at the songs 
Unfortunately Spotify does not return the entertainment agency linked to an artist, but this is something that, with a bit of patience, can be done manually by myself.

To give a small introduction: Compared to the evolution of rap in other countries, the general definition of what constitutes to rap is something that is still heavily discussed; even by active artists within the scene. Korean rap is often thought of to be based on American rap but more and more thoughts start to circle around whether the "Korean touch" added to the music is a good or a bad thing.

Most notably, I expect the adding of the Korean touch to be more apparent in two subcategories in the playlist: Highschool Rapper (HSR) and Show me The money (SMTM) albums.
Both HSR and SMTM are rap competition shows where highschool students and rappers in general have the opportunity to colllaborate with famous producers and fellow contestants as the shows go on. As much of the "staying in the competition" is dependent on how the Korean audience reacts to the songs, I suspect that we might see stark differences between songs produced on HSR/SMTM albums and other songs.

For the metrics, I have not yet decided on which to turn to but for now I see speechiness, energy as primary focus points. Valence might also be worth considering as HSR songs might score higher with often younger contestants.

Last but not least looking at the winning songs in HSR/SMTM compared to others might be worth something too (To identify trends in voting for specific producers)
